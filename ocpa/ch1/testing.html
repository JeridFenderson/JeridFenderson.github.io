	<h1>My Seond Heading</h1>
	<!--
	<h1 style="color: red">My Second Heading</h1>
	The "style=.." is the old HTML way to color the header. Don't do this way unless you specifically want to make this heading a different color than the rest. Most powerful, but also the most inefficent way to build a website.

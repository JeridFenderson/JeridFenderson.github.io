		<h1>How to Build Good Credit</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>I wrote an entire book on finances called <italics>The Best Dollar You'll Ever Spend.</italics>Go check it out on Amazon! Search my name, Jerid Fenderson, and both my books pop up.</p>
		<p>To sum it up, building credit is a long game, it takes time. As Warren Buffet once said, you can't have a baby in a month by getting 9 women pregnant. Start with what you can, and it'll grow from there, so long as you pay your debt on time.</p>
		<p>You don't have to do too many things right, so long as you don't do too many things wrong.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Get a credit card</li>
			<li>2. Have less than 10% of the limit get posted to the statement every month by paying it down before the statement closing date</li>
			<li>3. Ask for a credit limit increase</li>
			<li>4. Repeat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Also consider utilizing loans to help build your credit. But like I said, I wrote a whole book on the topic and I advise you to check it out.</p>
